WHAT AM I?

    Hello and welcome to Ink Complete, a lightweight application to allow for easier Client Management in the Tattoo Business. 
    
    In an age of Social Media, it's easy to showcase your work within your profile, and even easier to start scheduling clients via Direct Messages. However, that could get messy really quickly. What happens when your best friend schedules an appointment with you and now you have to scroll through a conversation full of shared videos and comments? That's prety time consuming.
    
   That's where Ink Complete comes in. It allows an artist to step away from their social media accounts, email and sketchbooks. Ink Complete offers a clean way to schedule, update and delete all the clients your heart desires.
